## History with Blockchain

Jan 2011 - Introduced to Bitcoin - The FBI raided a Hedge Funds office and we shipped all hardware back to Deloitte's forensic lab in Cayman (we had been engaged as liquidators, responsible to receover assets). Data was receovered from a scorched hard drive which included "Bitcoin wallets" on the CEO's computer. I was tasked to research what these were, and concluded that we may be able to recover the wallet's seed phrase from the printer's hard drive. Successfully recovered 500 bitcoins; but only worth $500 at the time, therefore low priority to the $250M fraud. 

July 2013 - Personal Deep Dive - While I had some time off before starting Brookfield, I researched all aspects of Bitcoin. I downloaded Bitcoin Core to start mining in Sept 2013. I know people who used Silk Road and my roommate was very Libertarian, so I needed to understand Bitcoin.

January 2014 - Joined Bitcoin Toronto meetup as one of first 250 members - the same group that ultimately founded Ethereum, ran by Anthony Di Iorio (group now called Decentral). Notables: Vitalik Buterin was the [6th member] (https://www.meetup.com/decentral_ca/members/?sort=joined&op=all&desc=0) in Oct 2012, Joseph Lubin #11 in Jan 2013, William Mougayar #83 in Jun 2013, Trevor Koverko #93 Jul 2013, Russell Verbeeten #175 in Nov 2013.

April 2014 - Invited to learn about Ethereum, dubbed "Bitcoin 2.0", and how to invest. I was not one of the 27 attendees.

Aug 2014 - Transferred nominal coins to Bitstamp. Hacked in early 2015. Lost faith in cryptocurrnecy but continued to follow.

Oct 2017 - Interviewed with a Big 5 bank to join their Blockchain Lab; hiring freeze delayed.

Mar 2018 - Left Brookfield to take the CBProâ„¢ at York to focus 110% on DLT.
